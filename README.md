# About Game
It is a simple Game App based on React Library, Here we are simulating matching pair card game to observe the memory of user. 

# Rules of the Game
Memory is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

# Installation steps
1. Since we are using React library so can use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to Bootstrap.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

2.Other Library dependencies - 
Other than React we are using react-router-dom (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) and axios (https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).

3. Where to find your code -
App code can be found on github (https://github.com/yogendraTechie/card_memory_game)

4. Game Scope Extension
We can track past scores of user and show him Best score, for this we can use localStorage of browser to record the previous attempts.
