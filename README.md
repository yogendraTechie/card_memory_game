# Installation steps

## Step 1

Since we are using React library so can use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to Bootstrap.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## Step 2

Other than React we are using react-router-dom (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) and prop-types (https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) libraries.

# Where to find your code

App code can be found on github (https://github.com/yogendraTechie/card_memory_game)

# Game Scope Extension

We can track past scores of user and show him Best score, for this we can use localStorage of browser to record the previous attempts.
